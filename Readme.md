### Charts for Blazor - How to filter the chart based on DataGrid selection

The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

This example shows how to change a Chart's data source based on a grid's selected row. For this, handle the grid's [SingleSelectedDataRowChanged][0] event and filter/update chart's data based on a selected row.
